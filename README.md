![Aurora](docs/Aurora.png)

An obsidian theme inspired by the vibrant colors of the aurora borealis, illuminating the night.

A minimalist theme with two main colors that allows you to stay focused and create a productive workspace.

⚠️ **Building in public**: This theme is currently in its initial phase, and what is published is only its first version, far from the desired result. I'll be working to include improvements and more features.
