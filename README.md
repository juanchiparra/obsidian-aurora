An obsidian theme inspired by the vibrant colors of the aurora borealis, illuminating the night.

A minimalist theme with two main colors that allows you to stay focused and create a productive workspace.

⚠️ **Building in public**: This theme is currently in its initial phase, and what is published is only its first version, far from the desired result. I'll be working to include improvements and more features.

## Contributing

Your contributions are welcome. If you find a bug or consider that there is something that can be improved, you are more than welcome to make a pull request or report it in issues.

## Credits

It would be unfair to omit the incredible [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) community. Their [Discord channel](https://obsidian.md/community) has allowed me in recent months, in addition to falling in love with the application, to teach me everything I needed to create this theme and, above all, to inspire me.

Thanks to everyone who has answered my questions.
